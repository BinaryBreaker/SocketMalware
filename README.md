# Maze Solving Algorithm with Hash and Space Solver

This is a Python-based algorithm for solving mazes using two different methods: the Hash Solver and the Space Solver. 

## Usage

To use this algorithm, simply provide an image of the maze as input. The algorithm will then solve the maze using either the Hash Solver or the Space Solver, depending on which one you choose. The algorithm will output an image of the maze with the solution path highlighted.

## Dependencies

This algorithm requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

To install the dependencies, simply run:

````
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
````

## Running the Algorithm

To run the algorithm, you can use the following command:

````
python maze_solver.py --input <path_to_input_image> --output <path_to_output_image> --solver <hash or space>

````

Here is what each of the arguments mean:

- `<path_to_input_image>`: the path to the input image of the maze.
- `<path_to_output_image>`: the path where you want to save the output image with the solution path highlighted.
- `<hash or space>`: the solver you want to use. Choose either `hash` or `space`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the algorithm:

````
python maze_solver.py --input input.png --output output.png --solver hash

````


This will solve the maze in the `input.png` image using the Hash Solver, and save the output image with the solution path highlighted as `output.png`.
